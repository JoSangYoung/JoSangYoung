Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hi! I’m SangYeong Jo — an artificial intelligence researcher & engineer interested in AI, data engineering, data analysis, and research. I design and ship robust vision systems that keep working when environments shift.

If you want to contact me, please leave me a message!

🔎 At a Glance

Vision: CV (classification / detection / segmentation), 2D/3D pose, 3D vision; shipped models in clinical products & manufacturing use‑cases.

Multimodal: Built vision+audio dance‑coaching engine (pose + beat sync) and vision+text pipelines (CLIP‑based product ID, dataset curation for VL tasks).

Core AI Algorithms: AAAI‑23 (Oral) POEM for domain generalization; experience with meta‑learning, causal analysis (CCM), optimization, and robust training (SWAD/SAM).

MLOps & Training: DDP/AMP, TorchScript/torch.compile, Docker, REST APIs, Celery, W&B; engine integration & validation in product environments; dataset governance.
